\subsection{Space-State Realisation}
The objective of this task is to derive a linearised dynamic system describing the motion of a quadcopter in the Choi/Ahn configuration. It is logical to develop a space-state representation of the system. There are 12 state quantities of interest in the given configuration; namely x, y, z coordinates to describe the drone's position in the inertial frame, linear and angular velocities in the body-fixed frame, and Euler angles. The state vector is defined by these 12 quantities and the state derivative by their respective time derivatives. Given (((BELOW/TO THE LEFT/ TO THE RIGHT???))) is the state vector and its derivative.

x = [u v w p q r | x y z phi theta psi]';
xdot = [ud vd wd pd qd rd | xd yd zd phid thetad psid]';

LITTLE DESCRIPTION FOR THE MATRIX - TOP HALF IS BODY FIXED, BOTTOM HALF IS INERTIAL

CIAN TO CIAN: PUT IN A FULL PICTURE OF THE STATE MATRIX

Our first task is to derive a general non-linear space-state representation of the configuration of the form:
