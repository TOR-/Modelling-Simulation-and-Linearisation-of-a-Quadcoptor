\section{Forces and Moments}
To model how the quadcopter interacts with its environment, we have derived the forces and moments that act upon it from first principles. The split of the forces into internal and external is a purely conceptual one.
\subsection{External forces}
The quadcopter chiefly experiences two external forces: the force of gravitational attraction between itself and the Earth and the retarding force of air friction or drag.
\subsubsection{Gravity $\vec{F}_g$}
The simplifications used in the derivation of the gravitational force are as follows: gravity was taken to have a constant magnitude of 9.81 \SI{}{\metre\per\second\squared}
